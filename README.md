# bend-go-meter
Diatonic Harmonica Tuner

A small tool to help you learn the bends on a diatonic harmonica. It takes
input from built in mic, recognises pitch and graphically shows you what note
you are playing and how accurately. Inspired by
[bend-o-meter](http://www.harpsoft.com/), which is great but not free.

[aubio](https://github.com/aubio/aubio) as dependencies. You can install
